# assignment3_weather
a weather app!


This is a API based project that combines what we learned on our javascript project!

-it gets the current weather
-it gets weekly weather
-it gets hourly weather
-and the daily summary
-you can search for cities
-you can refuse the location request and defaults on Edmonton
-added catches on each connnection so expect some alerts on your window.. but its not broken dont worry, most of the time its only
because the API bandwith reaches its limit
-it has some cool logo animation
-and its dark friendly(wont hurt your eyes)
